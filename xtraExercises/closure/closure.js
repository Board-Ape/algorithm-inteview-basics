What is a closure?

My Answer:
    The ability for a function to access the parent scopes variables.

Full Answer:
    Closure is an inner function that has access to the scope of an enclosing function.

    Access to 3 variables in separate scopres:
        1. Variables in its own scope
        2. Variables in the scope of the outer function
        3. Variables in the global scope
    
    The closure also has access to:
        1. Its own parameters
        2. Parameters of outer function(s)
